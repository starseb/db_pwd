pwd_data_base
=============

A small phtml app to helps me store some passwords in a database.
The app tells me if the db is empty or not(nÂ°  of passwords).
If the db is empty, puts the first password in the database.
If the password is already in the db, alert "password already in db!".
If the password isn't already in the db, add it to db.
